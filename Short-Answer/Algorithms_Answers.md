#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n): The worst case n can be infinite and inside the while loop a can trigger infinite times sequentially


b) Quadratic O(n^2): Loop inside the loop


c) Linear O(n): It runs until it hits the base case

## Exercise II
n ---> n story building(ordered)
eggs --> unlimited or infinite
f --> floor number

# start at the ground floor i.e. f = 0
f = 0
# loop through from ground floor to the nth floor
for f in range(0, n):
  # if the eggs are broken for a given f value then return True
  if eggs_broken is True:
    return True
  else:
  return None  

Linear: O(n) runs it from ground floor to nth floor (loop)
